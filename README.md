# Kingsisle-Trivia-Bot
For educational purposes only. 
This used to do all 10 trivias for you every day by storing all the trivia answers in files and selecting the right answer to each question. It also would use OCR from googles cloud vision to bypass the captcha which had prevented previous attempts at this learning project.
They recently blocked this and other bots from working by implementing googles recaptcha instead of their old captcha system.

This code is useless without the trivia answer files anyway which I lost, so you would have to create your own trivia files to get it working again.
